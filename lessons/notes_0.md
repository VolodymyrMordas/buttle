webpack - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack
An open-source JavaScript module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.[1] It takes the dependencies and generates a dependency graph allowing web developers to use a modular approach for their web application development purposes. The bundler can be used from the command line, or can be configured using a config file which is named webpack.config.js.[2] Node.js is required for installing webpack. Another important aspect about webpack is that it is highly extensible by the use of loaders. Loaders allow developers to write custom tasks that they want to perform when bundling files together. 

Webpack provides code on demand using the moniker code splitting. The Technical Committee 39 for ECMAScript is working on standardization of a function that loads additional code: proposal-dynamic-import.
